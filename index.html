    Hey there. This is apparently my GitHub Pages website... thing. This is a bit of a placeholder, as you can tell by the glorious lack of styling.
    But anyway, I'm a crappy software developer whose code is always a complete and utter mess, and I tend to make things sometimes, which usually
    aren't very good.
    <br /><br />
    Right now, I'm actively developing <a href="https://github.com/TntMatthew/ndsh">ndsh</a>, which is probably the worst shell in existence. It's
    fortunately becoming slightly less terrible, but it's still pretty terrible. At least I'm honest about it, I guess; hell, directly in the README
    I have a list of reasons why it sucks, which has sort of become a psuedo-checklist of things I need to add and/or fix. Feel free to fork and
    submit a pull request if you want to help out in making it not suck, though I doubt anybody waill since, as I mentioned above, the code is an
    absolute mess and is likely impossible to understand to anybody who isn't me. Even I kinda have trouble understanding it.
    <br /><br />
    Something else which I've created is <a href="https://github.com/TntMatthew/poshwrite">poshwrite</a> which is a text writer written in...
    PowerShell. Yeah. It's sort of like a CLI text editor with the "editor" removed and replaced with "writer". Problems with it include the fact
    you can't go back to previous lines you've entered, you can't load already existing files, and other various things. It's basically a PowerShell
    clone of the cmd <code>copy con</code> command, albeit with a basic (and I mean <em>baic</em>) UI. If you want a PowerShell text editor, you're not
    going to find it here, but I didn't make it for practical use. With some newfound knowledge I have recently obtained through developing ndsh, I should
    be able to create a better version of it, if I really wanted to. Overall, though, I'd wholeheartedly recommend using an actual CLI text editor not written
    by an idiot, like vim or nano.
    <br /><br />
    Anyway, I could continue to bore whatever person might be reading this, but I have nothing else to put here other than random facts about me, so I shall
    stop writing useless text into my editor and push this commit so this goes live.

    If you want to annoy me for whatever reason, throw me a tweet. My handle's <a href="https://twitter.com/TntMatthew">@TntMatthew</a>.
