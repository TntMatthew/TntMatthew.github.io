<p>
    Hi, I'm Tiyenti. Or as you may have known me, TntMatthew. I play video games, and sometimes - albeit very, very rarely - program some software. I also stream every now and then. I don't
    have much to say about myself, admittedly, so here, just have a few links to some game-related stuff I have made. I may post on the new <a href="{% link blog.html %}">blog</a> that this
    site now has every now and then, so maybe check that out.
</p>
