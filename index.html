           Hey there. This is apparently my GitHub Pages website... thing. As you can tell from the
           glorious lack of styling, this is a bit of a placeholder, but meh. I kind of like it this way.
            ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm a person who does things. I sometimes code, but not very
            often, because I usually don't have anything <i>to</i> code.
            I'm also a big fan of video games - specifically
            <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/233610">Distance</a>
            - speedrunning, and electronic music.
        </p>

        <h2>Information about me</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Stuff I've made:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://github.com/TntMatthew/unobtainibot">Unobtainibot</a> -
                    a sloppily coded discord.py bot (Python)</li>
                <li><a href="http://github.com/TntMatthew/ndsh">ndsh</a> - probably the worst
                    shell in the world (C#)</li>
                <li><a href="http://github.com/TntMatthew/poshwrite">poshwrite</a> - not a text editor
                    for rich people, but in fact, a PowerShell script for writing text to files (PowerShell)</li>
                <li><a href="http://github.com/TntMatthew/distplay">distplay</a> - controller input display
                    designed specifically for Distance (HTML/CSS/JS)</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://github.com/TntMatthew/dcli">dcli</a> - terminal based discord client for
                    Linux (Python)
                    <li><a href="http://tntmatthew.github.io/distance/terms.html">Distance Community Glossary</a> - a
                        list of every Distance community term you need to know ever</li>
            </ul>

                I've also made some electronic music. Only a hobbyist,
                only done singles so far, no albums, and it's nothing
                spectacular, but if you want to take a listen, head
                over to
                <a href="https://soundcloud.com/TntMatthew">my soundcloud.</a>
                Want to use it? See
                <a href="music-use.html">here</a>
                for my music usage policy/conditions statement thing.

            <b>Programming languages I know, or have used previously:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Python</b> - probably my main language ATM, whenever I do code something</li>
                <li>(some) <b>JavaScript</b></li>
                <li><b>C#</b> (though it's been a long time since
                    I've used it)</li>
                <li>I've messed with <b>Lua</b> in the past for
                    Open Hexagon levels, but I've never really used it
                    properly</li>
                <li>I've also dabbled with <b>PHP</b>, but only really
                    for making some adjustments to WordPress themes</li>
                <li>I messed with <b>PowerShell</b> a bit at one point,
                    hence poshwrite above. Though I don't use Windows as
                    my main OS anymore, so I don't think I'll use it
                    again</li>
                <li>Back in my earliest days of programming, I used to
                    use <b>VB.NET</b>, but it's been so long since I've
                    used it I've forgotten basically everything
                    about it.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b><i>Spoken</i> languages I know:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm a native speaker of <b>English</b>. I come from
                    the UK, but I tend to use both American and British
                    English in day to day speech, which I am unofficially
                dubbing "Briterican English".</li>
                <li>And I don't know anything else. So if you're, like,
                    Spanish, or something, please avoid any attempt
                    to communicate with me. It won't work.</li>
                <li>I do, however, have the temptation to attempt
                    learing Japanese, but I'm not sure if I ever
                    will go through with that. (one of my reasons for
                    not really wanting to go through with all that effort
                is because I wouldn't get to use it much, if at all.)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            There's not much else to me other than that.
            If you want to annoy me for whatever reason, throw me a tweet.
