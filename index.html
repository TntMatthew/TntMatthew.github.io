    Hey there. This is apparently my GitHub Pages website... thing. This is a bit of a placeholder, as you can tell by the glorious lack of styling.
    In the future, I will probably have some kind of thing here. But for now, here's a list of things I have somehow managed to create.

    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://github.com/TntMatthew/ndsh">ndsh - Neodymium shell</a> - an overly basic, feature incomplete, and just generally pretty sucky, shell</li>
        <li><a href="http://github.com/TntMatthew/poshwrite">poshwrite</a> - a powershell text writer</li>
    </ul>

    That's all for now.<br /><br />

    <div class="footer">[username@machinename] ~&gt; exit</div>
    </body>
