           Hey there. This is apparently my GitHub Pages website... thing. As you can tell from the
           glorious lack of styling, this is a bit of a placeholder, but meh. I kind of like it this way.
            ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm a bad developer, who writes code so messy I myself don't even know how it works.
            I've mostly used C#, but I'm starting to use Python now, so yeah. I've also messed
            with PowerShell, JavaScript, PHP, Lua, and C++ a bit, but I haven't really learned those.
            I used to use VB.NET but it's now been so long since I last used it that I've forgotten most
            of it.
        </p>
