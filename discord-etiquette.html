        <h1>Discord Etiquette</h1>
        This what I believe to be basic etiquette for public Discord
        servers. A lot of this can  be applied to IRC too. In no
        particular order:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Don't be a asshat.</b> This should be obvious.
                Yes, this is the internet, but you're speaking to real
                people. Not emotionless robots. Joking around and
                bantering is fine, but don't cross the line.</li>
            <li><b>Don't ping people for no good reason.</b>
                If you want to ask someone a question, or let them
                know of something important, pinging is usually fine, but
                doing it just 'cause is going to piss people off.</li>
            <li><b>By extension, don't DM people for no reason.</b> If
                you want to talk to someone privately, go ahead! That's
                what DMs are for, after all. But again, doing it just
                'cause isn't funny. It is annoying.</li>
            <li><b>Don't whine about nobody being around.</b>
                If nobody's responding to your questions, that likely
                means that either nobody is around, or nobody knows
                the answer. Someone will get to it eventually.
                You may want to try asking again at a more active
                time.</li>
            <li><b>Make your words count.</b> If you need help with something,
                don't just say <code>i need help</code>. Make it clear what
                you want.</li>
            <li><b>Don't spam.</b> Mass-posting content irrelevant to the
                current discussion is not conversation. If you want to post
                a lot of images, consider using an imgur album instead of posting
                them in the chat. For links, you can <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> to
                disable embeds, which take up a lot of space and can be irritating
                in large quantities.</li>
            <li><b>Don't overuse reactions.</b> Using reactions in moderation
                is fine, but going overboard with them is not okay. Fortunately,
                never using them is always okay.</li>
            <li><b>Don't overuse bots.</b> Bots are fun, but spamming bot
                commands is just irritating for the rest of the server.
                Some servers may have a bots channel for heavy command
                usage - use that instead of a discussion channel.</li>
            <li><b>Stay on topic.</b> Discord servers often have
                multiple channels for a reason - use them.</li>
            <li><b>Don't post the same question in every channel on
                the server.</b> Post the question once in the correct
                channel, and wait. Sooner or later, you will get a
                response.</li>
            <li><b>Don't use formatting or CAPS excessively.</b>
                Occsional all-bold, all-caps or similar is okay...
                but don't do it all the time.</li>
            <li><b>Don't ping admin or mod roles unless it's
                absolutely urgent.</b> Again, this should be obvious.
                Alerting the whole mod/admin team for something minor
                is just unnecessary.</li>
            <li><b>Don't advertise.</b> If it's relevant, and the server
                rules allow it, it's fine to post some of your own content
                or where to find it every now and then, but don't spam it.</li>
            <li><b>Grow a thick skin.</b> You'll need it. On the Internet,
                people are assholes. Don't take anything personally.</li>
            <li><b>Follow the server's rules.</b> Once again, this should
                be obvious. While this list provides a general idea of
                how you should behave, every server is different. Follow
                the rules.</li>
            <li><b>Don't do stuff just to annoy people.</b> If someone
                doesn't like what you're doing and wants you to stop,
                stop.</li>
        </ul>

        That's all I can think of for now. I'll be updating this
        as I think of more stuff.
