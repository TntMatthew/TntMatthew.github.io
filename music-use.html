        <p>
            I know how hard it can be to find good music you can use in your
            YouTube videos or Twitch streams. I know my stuff isn't exactly
            good, but if you want to use any of it in your streams or videos, feel
            free to do so; no need to ask for permission (though giving me a heads
            up never hurts).
        </p>

        <p>
            I can't really do anything to stop you from violating these, but here's
            my conditions:

            <ul>
                <li><b>Give me credit.</b> I don't really care what it is; it can
                    be a now playing indicator, or just links to my
                    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/TntMatthew">SoundCloud</a>
                    and/or <a href="https://twitter.com/TntMatthew">Twitter</a>
                    in your description, but ensure it's clearly visible.</li>
                <li><b>Don't claim it as your own.</b> This should be obvious.</li>
                <li><b>Don't reupload just the music, or just the music with
                    a mute video / animation or still image accompanying it.</b> It should be
                    accompanied by commentary, or game audio, or something.
                    Small parts of the music used as intro or outro music,
                    for instance, are exempt from this - just don't reupload
                    the full song. This especially holds true if I ever decide to charge
                    for my music in the future.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            But note <b>this only applies to using my music in your streams or videos!</b>
            If you want to use it in a game, some other live event, or anywhere else,
            really, you're gonna have to ask me first. Contact me via twitter or
            something. Again, I'm not too strict, and in most cases I'd be willing
            to let you use my stuff, but you should always make sure that whatever
            you're doing's okay with me first.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll also say that I've love to hear any covers or remixes
            of my tracks that will possibly make them sound much better,
            so you can feel free to make those too. Once again, you don't
            need to ask for permission, but <b>please give me credit and
            link to the original song</b> if you choose to publish it. I'd
            really appreciate you sending it my way as well so I can take
            a listen to it myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Note that I may revise these terms at any point, potentially
            without warning.</b> I don't really feel like being that big of
            an ass to not let people know, but I reserve the right to do
            that anyway, because screw you, that's why.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now I'd put a link here to go back to the main site, but your
            web browser has a back button. And you can see the url in the
            address bar. I'm not doing the work for you.
