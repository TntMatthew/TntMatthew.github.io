            I know how hard it can be to find good music you can use in your
            YouTube videos or Twitch streams. I know my stuff isn't exactly
            good, but if you want to use any of it in your streams or videos, feel
            free to do so; no need to ask for permission (though giving me a heads
            up never hurts).
        </p>

        <p>
            My only condition is that you credit me in your video,
            through the form of a "Now Playing" indicator or links to
            my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/TntMatthew">SoundCloud</a>
            and/or <a href="https://twitter.com/TntMatthew">Twitter</a>
            in your description. I'm not overly strict on how you do it,
            just make sure you give me credit in some form, and ensure that
            it's clearly visible so people can find where to get the music
            if they happen to like it. Something like this in your
            video description would do:

            <pre>
Music by TntMatthew
SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/TntMatthew
Twitter: https://twitter.com/TntMatthew
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            But note <b>this only applies to using my music in your streams or videos!</b>
            If you want to use it in a game, some other live event, or anywhere else,
            really, you're gonna have to ask me first. Contact me via twitter or
            something. Again, I'm not too strict, and in most cases I'd be willing
            to let you use my stuff, but you should always make sure that whatever
            you're doing's okay with me first. <b>This includes reuploading
            the music somewhere else</b> - don't do this without my
            permission. If you do get permission from me to do this,
            please make sure you make it clearly obvious that it is
            not your music, and put a link to my SoundCloud and/or
            Twitter somewhere in the description of your mirror. I mean,
            I can't really do anything to stop you from violating
            these terms, but please, don't be an ass :|
        </p>

        <p>
            I'll also say that I've love to hear any covers or remixes
            of my tracks that will possibly make them sound much better,
            so you can feel free to make those too. Once again, you don't
            need to ask for permission, but <b>please give me credit and
            link to the original song</b> if you choose to publish it. I'd
            really appreciate you sending it my way as well so I can take
            a listen to it myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Note that I may revise these terms at any point, potentially
            without warning.</b> I don't really feel like being that big of
            an ass to not let people know, but I reserve the right to do
            that anyway, because screw you, that's why. (Last updated:

            Now I'd put a link here to go back to the main site, but your
            web browser has a back button. And you can see the url in the
            address bar. I'm not doing the work for you.
